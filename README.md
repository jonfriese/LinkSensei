#LinkSensei

Authors: Jon Friese, Andre Bautista, Brian Davis

LinkSensei is a web productivity tool for saving, arranging, and sharing favorite links.

As a registered user, you are able to create and store links with tag words and a description of how the link may have helped you. They can then be grouped.

When a user logs in, they will see a homepage, listing their saved links, or link groups, and a form for entering new links.  They can choose to make links public or private, and can see a list of other users, or connections with whom they can share links.

Projected functionality will include a browser extension which allows one-click importing of open window tabs into the link staging area.
